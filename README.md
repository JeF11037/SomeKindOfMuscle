This is repository for 01.06 teacher task. I have to write 3 SQL request and do some mistake in them.
### First request to delete a database.
```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name
```
### Second request to return the largest value from given column.
```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;
```
### Third request to return column where column is equal to first value or to second value.
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name = value_1 ELSE column_name = value_2;
```
